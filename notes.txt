we can use this text file for informal notes on what we did, changes, questions, resolutions, etc.
JB: To add a line to the file, I used the following command: echo "we can use this text file for informal notes on what we did, changes, questions, resolutions, etc." >> notes.txt

JB: To read from the file in the terminal, I used: cat notes.txt
to check for local changes, I used: git status
'git status' showed me that there were changes to 'notes.txt', listed as an Untracked file
using 'mkdir deleteme', I created a new directory. Now 'git status' will show two untracked files: notes.txt and deleteme
Actually, I was surprised to see that it still only shows one untracked file (notes.txt). I learned that github does not track empty directories.
Using 'touch deleteme.txt' and 'mv deleteme.txt deleteme', I have created a file and added it to the deleteme directory. Now I expect it to show as an untracked file using 'git status'.

Using 'git branch <branch>' I will create a branch for myself to track my changes.
using 'git checkout jeff' I switched to the new branch I created. Now I will add the changes to be committed using 'git add notes.txt'. I could also use 'git add .' to add all changes, but I do not want to save the directory 'deleteme'. I will delete that with 'rm -rf deleteme'.
